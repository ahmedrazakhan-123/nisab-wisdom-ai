**‚úÖ Zakatable Assets:**
‚Ä¢ Cash, savings, investments
‚Ä¢ Gold, silver, jewelry (for trade)
‚Ä¢ Business inventory and trade goods
‚Ä¢ Stocks, mutual funds, crypto (if halal)

**‚ùå Exempt Assets:**
‚Ä¢ Primary residence
‚Ä¢ Personal car and household items
‚Ä¢ Tools for profession/trade

Instead of interest, the bank buys the property and either:
1. Sells it to you at a higher price (Murabaha)
2. Leases it to you with option to buy (Ijara)
